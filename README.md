This is a CRM software for the jewelry company Gems From Jaipur. 

For this project, I:
- Worked with CEO to create secure internal tool to manage lifecycle of jewelry creation and distribution
- Developed backend server using a Postgresql database, business logic and frontend using NextJS, hosted on Vercel
- Eliminated errors from paper record-keeping that were costing the company $4000 a year

Chose to make this open source, just in case another jewelry company might want to use it. 

## Getting started with contributing(Courtesy NextJS)

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
